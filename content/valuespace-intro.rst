Introduction
------------

I will start with a bit of history. Few years ago,
I got interested in the then-budding "IPython notebook" project,
and saw that Leo could be a way to reach that goal with minimal
amount of programming.

(Right now, IPython notebook is a phenomenal succes story
implemented with web technologies, but that's another story).
